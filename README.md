TAGS, the Totally Awesome Geolocator Service, is <a href="https://tags.shinyapps.io/tags_shiny/">back online</a>.  This web-based service allows you to edit messy geolocator data in a point-and-click format while saving excluded values for reproducible work.  TAGS automatically suggests potential problem areas, lets you move from problem to problem to edit, and shows a map of coordinates generated from your data given your current edits.   Please clone the code from the repository to use it on your own computer for datasets >30 mb.
