TAGS, the Totally Awesome Geolocator Service, will be back online in August 2018.  This web-based service allows you to edit messy geolocator data in a point-and-click format while saving excluded values for reproducible work.  TAGS automatically suggests potential problem areas, lets you move from problem to problem to edit, and shows a map of coordinates generated from your data given your current edits. 

As of 24 June 2018, TAGS is now functional.  Please clone the code from the repository to use it on your own computer.  It will be released as a web app before the IOC2018 meeting in mid-August 2018.
